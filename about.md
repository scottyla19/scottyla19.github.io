My name is Scott LaForest and I am a math/engineering teacher as well as a coach of basketball currently and football and track in the past. Being a life long learner I am constantly looking for new skills to learn and data analysis does this for me. My hope is to post a lot of my analysis here and share it with others. 

Being an avid sports fan, teacher, and coach a lot of the topics here will be sports or educational topics. Hopefully we can satisfy our curiosity and learn together.
