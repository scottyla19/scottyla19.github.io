Explanation of the columns in the table above: 
- Each question has a general 'Category'
- Total Agree is the sum of Strongly Agree and Agree
- Total Disagree is the sum of Disagree and Strongly Disagree
- Wording is 0 for positive (something we want to agree highly) and 1 for negative (statements we would want to disagree with).
- Total Positive is equal to Total Agree if Wording is positive and Total Disagree if Wording is negative. The higher the better.

## Staff Analysis
Below you can see the average of total percentage of positive answers for each of the main categories. In general it seems staff has fun, is confident, enjoys support from colleagues. However it seems administration, leadership, and communication could be areas of improvement.


```python

catStaff = staff.groupby('Category')
catStaff['Total Positive'].mean()
```




    Category
    Administration and Communication    54.283333
    Belonging                           63.650000
    Confidence to Take Action           83.200000
    Curiosity & Creativity              66.362500
    Fun & Excitement                    88.742857
    Heroes                              84.287500
    Leadership & Responsibility         62.957143
    Sense of Accomplishment             69.866667
    Spirit of Adventure                 65.557143
    Name: Total Positive, dtype: float64



Below is a list of the questions that were low (<50%) positive  answers. Some things to look into is that majority of staff (50.8%) agree that bullying is a problem while only 25.5% disagree. This is why there is only a 25.4% persent Total Positive amount. Since we would want everyone to agree that bullying is **not** a problem at our school. This is something to look into and so is lack of meaningful professional development #36, lack of effective communication #60, lack of decision making, and lack of administration learning from staff.


```python
posStaff = staff[staff['Total Positive'] < 50.0]

# posStaff.set_index('Question', inplace=True)

posStaff = posStaff.reindex(columns=["Category", "Question", "Total Agree", "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Undecided", 
                                     "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree","Did Not Answer", "Total Disagree", "Total Positive",
                                     "Wording"])
posStaff.head(len(posStaff))
```

## Student Analysis
Doing a similar analysis for the student data provides more information on the overall thoughts of the students. Below are the breakdowns of each of the categories for the students.



```python
catStudent = students.groupby('Category')
catStudent['Total Positive'].mean()

```




    Category
    Belonging                      52.250000
    Confidence to Take Action      72.050000
    Curiosity & Creativity         60.410000
    Fun & Excitement               49.100000
    Heroes                         56.977778
    Leadership & Responsibility    47.428571
    Sense of Accomplishment        60.122222
    Spirit of Adventure            57.514286
    Name: Total Positive, dtype: float64



Not a very good prognosis for the students compared to the way the staff feel. Student seem to have high confidence, curiosity, and sense of accomplishment. In general these responses do not seem as positive as the staff. However more of the students chose undecided as there answer compared with the staff. This could influence the outcome either way but it is something for us to make sure students are aware of an for them to be more decisive when taking the survey.


```python
print('Students mean undecided percentage: %{:.2f}.\nStaff mean undecided percentage: %{:.2f}.'.format(students['Undecided'].mean(), staff['Undecided'].mean()))
```

    Students mean undecided percentage: %25.14.
    Staff mean undecided percentage: %13.83.
    


```python
posStudent = students[students['Total Positive'] < 50.0]

# posStaff.set_index('Question', inplace=True)

posStudent = posStudent.reindex(columns=["Category", "Question", "Total Agree", "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Undecided",

The above table shows the questions with more negative answers than positive. However looking at the outcomes many of the responses have a high percentage of Undecided answers, most of them having over a third of the answers being undecided. In order to examine these questions more we need to adjust the percentages of the other responses. My choice is to calculate new percentages for Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, and Strongly Agree without the students who chose Undecided. Then we will update the Total Positive column to reflect these updated percentages.


```python
# cols = list(students)
cols = [ 'Strongly Agree','Agree', 'Disagree', 'Strongly Disagree']
# cols = [e for e in cols if e not in ('Total Agree','Undecided', 'Did Not Answer', 'Total Disagree', 'Total Positive', 'Wording')]
students['TotalDecided'] = students[cols].sum(axis=1)
decidedStudents = students.copy()
decidedStudents['Strongly Agree'] = round(100*(students['Strongly Agree']/students['TotalDecided']),2)
decidedStudents['Agree'] = round(100*(students['Agree']/students['TotalDecided']),2)
decidedStudents['Disagree'] = round(100*(students['Disagree']/students['TotalDecided']),2)
decidedStudents['Strongly Disagree'] = round(100*(students['Strongly Disagree']/students['TotalDecided']),2)
decidedStudents['Total Agree'] = decidedStudents['Strongly Agree'] + decidedStudents['Agree']
decidedStudents['Total Disagree'] = decidedStudents['Strongly Disagree'] + decidedStudents['Disagree']
decidedStudents['Total Positive'] = np.where(decidedStudents['Wording'] == 0, decidedStudents['Total Agree'],decidedStudents['Total Disagree']) 


```

After eliminating the undecided students it looks a lot more positive for the total feeling of the student body. For the most part the students are positive with high confidence levels and low fun and responsibility.


```python
catDecStudent = decidedStudents.groupby('Category')
catDecStudent['Total Positive'].mean()
```

After eliminating the undecided students and calculating new percentages based off of the decisive answers provides us with only four questions that have negative total answers. These four topics are things that we can do better as a staff to help students feel more welcome, less bored, and more appreciated. This might not be the best method of determining what the undecided students would have on the population. What we will do in the future is to make sure students are more decisive when filling out the survey as many of the questions had over one third of the population Undecided. Of the students that did answer it was overall pretty positive and also gives the staff direction on the four top priorties to focus our efforts to improve the school culture.
