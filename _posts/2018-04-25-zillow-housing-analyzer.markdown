# Housing Analyzer App

With my family looking to relocate I thought it would be the perfect time to look into housing prices across the country. Luckily Zillow supplies a lot of their data for free at [Zillow Research] (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/).

Using this data I applied some basic data manipulation and analysis combined with the python Dash library to create the following hosted on heroku.

[Zip Code Housing Analyzer](https://zip-code-housing-analysis.herokuapp.com/)

The app allows users to hover over their area on the map to find average price per square foot. Also users can compare multiple states, metro areas, and even individual zip codes using the dropdown boxes. Choose some areas and compare typical price per square foot.
