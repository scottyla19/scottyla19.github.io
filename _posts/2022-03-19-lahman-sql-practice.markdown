# Lahman's Baseball db SQL practice
I wanted to brush off some of the rust for my SQL skills and I figured the Lahman Baseball database offers a decent database to practice. I downloaded the install script from here and found some practice exercises here. The rest of this post are my attempts to solve the problems. ~~Play Ball!~~ Query data!

## Question 1: 
#### What range of years does the provided database cover?


```sql
%%sql 
SELECT 
    MIN(yearID) AS first_year, MAX(yearID) AS last_year
FROM
    batting;
```

     * mysql+mysqlconnector://root:***@localhost:3306/lahmansbaseballdb
    1 rows affected.





<table>
    <tr>
        <th>first_year</th>
        <th>last_year</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1871</td>
        <td>2019</td>
    </tr>
</table>



## Question 2: 
#### Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    p1.playerID,
    p1.nameFirst,
    p1.nameLast,
    p1.height,
    SUM(apps.G_all) AS games_played,
    t.name
FROM
    people p1
        INNER JOIN
    (SELECT 
        MIN(people.height) AS min_height
    FROM
        people) p2 ON p1.height = p2.min_height
        INNER JOIN
    appearances AS apps ON p1.playerID = apps.playerID
        INNER JOIN
    teams t ON t.teamID = apps.teamID
GROUP BY p1.playerID , p1.nameFirst , p1.nameLast , p1.height , t.name;

```

     * mysql+mysqlconnector://root:***@localhost:3306/lahmansbaseballdb
    1 rows affected.





<table>
    <tr>
        <th>playerID</th>
        <th>nameFirst</th>
        <th>nameLast</th>
        <th>height</th>
        <th>games_played</th>
        <th>name</th>
    </tr>

        <td>43</td>
        <td>52</td>
        <td>St. Louis Browns</td>
    </tr>
</table>



# Question 3: 
#### Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    p.nameFirst, p.nameLast, SUM(s.salary) total_salary
FROM
    people p
        INNER JOIN
    salaries s ON s.playerID = p.playerID
        INNER JOIN
    collegeplaying cp ON p.playerID = cp.playerID
        INNER JOIN
    schools sc ON sc.schoolID = cp.schoolID
WHERE
    sc.name_full = 'Vanderbilt University'
GROUP BY p.nameFirst , p.nameLast
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;
```

# Question 4:
#### Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN POS = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
        WHEN POS IN ('P' , 'C') THEN 'Battery'
        ELSE 'Infield'
    END AS POS_Group,
    SUM(PO) AS 'Putouts'
FROM

## Question 5:
#### Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    FLOOR(yearID / 10) * 10 AS decade,
    AVG(SO / G) 'K per Game',
    AVG(HR / G) 'HR per Game'
FROM
    teams
WHERE
    yearID >= 1920
GROUP BY decade;

## Question 6:
#### Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    p.nameFirst,
    p.nameLast,
    ROUND(b.SB / (b.SB + b.CS), 2) AS sb_perc
FROM
    batting b
        INNER JOIN
    people p ON p.playerID = b.playerID
WHERE
    b.SB + b.CS >= 20 AND b.yearID = 2016
ORDER BY sb_perc DESC;

## Question 7:
#### From 1970 â€“ 2019, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series? What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion â€“ determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. How often from 1970 â€“ 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?


```sql
%%sql

        t2.WSWin = 'N' AND t2.yearID >= 1970
    ORDER BY t2.W DESC

## Question 8:
#### Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 (where average attendance is defined as total attendance divided by number of games). Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.
